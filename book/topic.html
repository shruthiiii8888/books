    <pre>Installing Python:
        To begin with Python, you need to have it installed on your computer. You can download the latest version from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/).
        
        Hello, World!
        Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" program to display text on the screen:
        
        python
        Copy code
        print("Hello, World!")
        Variables and Data Types:
        In Python, you don't need to declare a variable's data type explicitly. Python will infer it for you. Here are some common data types:
        
        python
        Copy code
        # Integers
        x = 10
        
        # Floating-point numbers
        y = 3.14
        
        # Strings
        name = "Alice"
        
        # Booleans
        is_true = True
        Comments:
        You can add comments to your code using the # symbol. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and are useful for adding explanations to your code.
        
        python
        Copy code
        # This is a comment
        Indentation:
        Python uses indentation (whitespace) to indicate blocks of code. Make sure to maintain consistent indentation levels to avoid errors.
        
        python
        Copy code
        if x > 5:
            print("x is greater than 5")
        Basic Operations:
        Python supports common mathematical and logical operations.
        
        python
        Copy code
        # Arithmetic operations
        sum_result = 10 + 5
        difference = 10 - 5
        product = 10 * 5
        quotient = 10 / 5
        remainder = 10 % 3
        
        # Comparison operators
        is_equal = x == y
        is_not_equal = x != y
        is_greater = x > y
        is_less = x < y
        
        # Logical operators
        and_result = True and False
        or_result = True or False
        not_result = not True
        Conditional Statements:
        Use if, elif (else if), and else to control the flow of your program based on conditions.
        
        python
        Copy code
        if x > 5:
            print("x is greater than 5")
        elif x == 5:
            print("x is equal to 5")
        else:
            print("x is less than 5")
        Loops:
        Python provides for and while loops for iterating over sequences or executing code repeatedly.
        
        python
        Copy code
        # for loop
        for i in range(5):
            print(i)
        
        # while loop
        counter = 0
        while counter < 5:
            print(counter)
            counter += 1
        Functions:
        Functions allow you to encapsulate and reuse blocks of code.
        
        python
        Copy code
        def greet(name):
            print(f"Hello, {name}!")
        
        greet("Alice")
        Lists:
        Lists are ordered collections of items, and they can contain elements of different data types.
        
        python
        Copy code
        my_list = [1, 2, 3, "four", 5.0]
        These are some fundamental concepts in Python. As you become more familiar with the language, you can explore more advanced topics like classes, modules, file handling, and libraries to expand your Python skills and solve a wide range of programming tasks.
