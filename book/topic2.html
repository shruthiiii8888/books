        Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. Python provides the if, elif (else if), and else statements to implement conditional logic. Here's an overview of conditional statements in Python:

if Statement:
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

python
Copy code
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
elif Statement:
The elif (else if) statement is used to specify an alternative condition to check if the initial if condition is false. You can have multiple elif statements.

python
Copy code
grade = 85
if grade >= 90:
    print("A")
elif grade >= 80:
    print("B")
elif grade >= 70:
    print("C")
else:
    print("D")
else Statement:
The else statement is used to specify a block of code that will be executed if none of the preceding if or elif conditions are true.

python
Copy code
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
Nested if Statements:
You can nest if, elif, and else statements within each other to handle more complex conditions.

python
Copy code
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
    if age >= 21:
        print("You can also drink alcohol.")
else:
    print("You are not an adult.")
Ternary Conditional Operator (Conditional Expression):
Python supports a concise way to write simple conditional statements using the ternary conditional operator. It allows you to assign values to a variable based on a condition.

python
Copy code
age = 18
message = "You are an adult" if age >= 18 else "You are not an adult"
print(message)
Logical Operators: You can use logical operators (and, or, not) to combine multiple conditions in your if and elif statements.

python
Copy code
x = 10
y = 5
if x > 5 and y > 3:
    print("Both conditions are true")
Comparisons: Conditional statements often use comparison operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=) to evaluate conditions based on the comparison of variables or values.

python
Copy code
x = 10
if x == 10:
    print("x is equal to 10")
Conditional statements are fundamental to controlling the flow of your Python programs and making them responsive to different situations. They allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on the truth or falsehood of conditions.
