        In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly specify the data type of a variable when declaring it. Here are some key points about variables in Python:

Variable Declaration: To declare a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to a variable name using the equal (=) operator.

Example:

python
Copy code
name = "Alice"
age = 30
Data Types: Python supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, and more. The data type of a variable is determined dynamically based on the value it holds.

Example:

python
Copy code
age = 30             # Integer
price = 19.99        # Float
name = "Alice"      # String
is_valid = True     # Boolean
my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # List
Variable Naming Rules:

Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
Variable names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables).
Reserved Keywords: You cannot use Python's reserved keywords as variable names because they have special meanings in the language. Examples of reserved keywords include if, else, for, while, def, and class.

Variable Assignment: You can change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it.

Example:

python
Copy code
age = 30
age = 31  # Reassigning the value of the 'age' variable
Multiple Assignments: Python allows multiple assignments in a single line.

Example:

python
Copy code
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, so you can change the data type of a variable by assigning it a new value of a different type.

Example:

python
Copy code
x = 10       # x is an integer
x = "hello"  # x is now a string
Global and Local Scope: Variables can have local or global scope. Variables defined within a function are local to that function, while variables defined outside of any function are considered global and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

Deleting Variables: You can delete a variable using the del statement.

Example:

python
Copy code
x = 10
del x  # Deletes the variable 'x'
These are some fundamental concepts related to variables in Python. Variables play a crucial role in storing and manipulating data, making Python a versatile and powerful programming language.
